# TypeScript
everything i have done on typescript
it has a ststic checker which checks on eeryu step that wheter on every step whether it has not correct or not.

Types :: Number  String      Boolean
         NUll    Undefined   Void
         Object  Array       Tuples
         Any     Never       Unknown 

Syntax :: let variable_name: type = value;

noimplicitany() is to remove any implicit ny in the code
