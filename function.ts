// in functions type casting is done in different way
// here is the way to do that

function addtwo( num : number) : number {

    return num + 2;
    
}
// in this way we use it to define types first to declare the types of the parameteres that we are utilising in the function and secondly the return type of the function 
// it is really necessary that we dont ecounter the any variable in any case
// as it is relly not desired
